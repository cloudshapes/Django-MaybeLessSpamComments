=============================

**Less spam in Django comments using Akismet, Recaptcha and profanity checking**.

MaybeLessSpamComments is a set of apps that enable you to have greater control over spam - and less spam - in Django comments.

The code is compatible with:

* Django 1.3.1.
* Grapelli (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-grappelli, version on 13/10/11), and Filebrowser (https://github.com/sehmaschine/django-filebrowser, , version on 13/10/11)

Includes a small extension to the standard Django Admin interface: i.e. a link to quickly delete all comments that have been flagged as spam by Akismet.

Finally, the code includes a fully working sample Django project.
